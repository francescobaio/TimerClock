# TimerClock

Welcome to the TimerClock repository! This project is a programming laboratory focused on creating a timer and clock functionality using C++ and QMake.

## About The Project

TimerClock is designed as an educational project to explore the intricacies of time manipulation and GUI application development in C++. It's structured into several test files and core components that define the behavior of timers and clocks.

## Files and Directories

- `TestChrono`, `TestMyTime`, `TestTime`, `TestTimer`: Test files for different timing functionalities.
- `MyTime.cpp/h`, `TimeDate.cpp/h`: Core logic for handling time and date operations.
- `chrono.cpp/h`, `clock.cpp/h`: Components that deal with chrono functionality and clock operations.
- `mainwindow.cpp/h`, `mainwindow.ui`: Main window GUI elements and interactions.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

## Languages Used

- C++ (89.6%)
- QMake (10.4%)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:
